## Option 2: Build Docker Image with Model Inside

To build an image with the model baked in, you must specify the following docker arguments when building the image.

### Prerequisites

- Docker

### Arguments

- **Required**
  - `MODEL_NAME`
- **Optional**
  - `MODEL_REVISION`: Model revision to load (default: `main`).
  - `BASE_PATH`: Storage directory where huggingface cache and model will be located. (default: `/runpod-volume`, which will utilize network storage if you attach it or create a local directory within the image if you don't. If your intention is to bake the model into the image, you should set this to something like `/models` to make sure there are no issues if you were to accidentally attach network storage.)
  - `QUANTIZATION`
  - `WORKER_CUDA_VERSION`: `12.1.0` (`12.1.0` is recommended for optimal performance).
  - `TOKENIZER_NAME`: Tokenizer repository if you would like to use a different tokenizer than the one that comes with the model. (default: `None`, which uses the model's tokenizer)
  - `TOKENIZER_REVISION`: Tokenizer revision to load (default: `main`).

For the remaining settings, you may apply them as environment variables when running the container. Supported environment variables are listed in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

### Example: Building an image with OpenChat-3.5

```bash
docker build -t username/image:tag --build-arg MODEL_NAME="openchat/openchat_3.5" --build-arg BASE_PATH="/models" .
```

### (Optional) Including Huggingface Token

If the model you would like to deploy is private or gated, you will need to include it during build time as a Docker secret, which will protect it from being exposed in the image and on DockerHub.

1. Enable Docker BuildKit (required for secrets).

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```

2. Export your Hugging Face token as an environment variable

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```

2. Add the token as a secret when building

```bash
docker build -t username/image:tag --secret id=HF_TOKEN --build-arg MODEL_NAME="openchat/openchat_3.5" .
```

# Compatible Model Architectures

You can deploy **any model on Hugging Face** that is supported by vLLM. For the complete and up-to-date list of supported model architectures, see the [vLLM Supported Models documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html#list-of-text-only-language-models).

# Usage: OpenAI Compatibility

The vLLM Worker is fully compatible with OpenAI's API, and you can use it with any OpenAI Codebase by changing only 3 lines in total. The supported routes are <ins>Chat Completions</ins> and <ins>Models</ins> - with both streaming and non-streaming.

## Modifying your OpenAI Codebase to use your deployed vLLM Worker

**Python** (similar to Node.js, etc.):

1. When initializing the OpenAI Client in your code, change the `api_key` to your RunPod API Key and the `base_url` to your RunPod Serverless Endpoint URL in the following format: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1`, filling in your deployed endpoint ID. For example, if your Endpoint ID is `abc1234`, the URL would be `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/abc1234/openai/v1`.

   - Before:

   ```python
   from openai import OpenAI

   client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
   ```

   - After:

   ```python
   from openai import OpenAI

   client = OpenAI(
       api_key=os.environ.get("RUNPOD_API_KEY"),
       base_url="https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1",
   )
   ```

2. Change the `model` parameter to your deployed model's name whenever using Completions or Chat Completions.
   - Before:
   ```python
   response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
       temperature=0,
       max_tokens=100,
   )
   ```
   - After:
   ```python
   response = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
       messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
       temperature=0,
       max_tokens=100,
   )
   ```

**Using http requests**:

1. Change the `Authorization` header to your RunPod API Key and the `url` to your RunPod Serverless Endpoint URL in the following format: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1`
   - Before:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
   -d '{
   "model": "gpt-4",
   "messages": [
     {
       "role": "user",
       "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"
     }
   ],
   "temperature": 0,
   "max_tokens": 100
   }'
   ```
   - After:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1/chat/completions \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR OPENAI API KEY>" \
   -d '{
   "model": "<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
   "messages": [
     {
       "role": "user",
       "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"
     }
   ],
   "temperature": 0,
   "max_tokens": 100
   }'
   ```

## OpenAI Request Input Parameters:

When using the chat completion feature of the vLLM Serverless Endpoint Worker, you can customize your requests with the following parameters:

### Examples: Using your RunPod endpoint with OpenAI

First, initialize the OpenAI Client with your RunPod API Key and Endpoint URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Initialize the OpenAI Client with your RunPod API Key and Endpoint URL
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=os.environ.get("RUNPOD_API_KEY"),
    base_url="https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1",
)
```

### Chat Completions:

This is the format used for GPT-4 and focused on instruction-following and chat. Examples of Open Source chat/instruct models include `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`, `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`, `openchat/openchat-3.5-0106`, `NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO` and more. However, if your model is a completion-style model with no chat/instruct fine-tune and/or does not have a chat template, you can still use this if you provide a chat template with the environment variable `CUSTOM_CHAT_TEMPLATE`.

  ```python
  # Create a chat completion stream
  response_stream = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=100,
      stream=True,
  )
  # Stream the response
  for response in response_stream:
      print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
  ```
- **Non-Streaming**:
  ```python
  # Create a chat completion
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=100,
  )
  # Print the response
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```

### Getting a list of names for available models:

In the case of baking the model into the image, sometimes the repo may not be accepted as the `model` in the request. In this case, you can list the available models as shown below and use that name.

```python
models_response = client.models.list()
list_of_models = [model.id for model in models_response]
print(list_of_models)
```

  <summary>Click to expand table</summary>
    
  You may either use a `prompt` or a list of `messages` as input. If you use `messages`, the model's chat template will be applied to the messages automatically, so the model must have one. If you use `prompt`, you may optionally apply the model's chat template to the prompt by setting `apply_chat_template` to `true`.

### Text Input Formats

You may either use a `prompt` or a list of `messages` as input.

1.  `prompt`
    The prompt string can be any string, and the model's chat template will not be applied to it unless `apply_chat_template` is set to `true`, in which case it will be treated as a user message.

        Example:
        ```json
        {
          "input": {
            "prompt": "why sky is blue?",
            "sampling_params": {
              "temperature": 0.7,
              "max_tokens": 100
            }
          }
        }
        ```

2.  `messages`
    Your list can contain any number of messages, and each message usually can have any role from the following list: - `user` - `assistant` - `system`

    However, some models may have different roles, so you should check the model's chat template to see which roles are required.

    The model's chat template will be applied to the messages automatically, so the model must have one.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "input": {
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a helpful AI assistant that provides clear and concise responses."
          },
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Can you explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"
          },
          {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Sure! Supervised learning uses labeled data, meaning each input has a corresponding correct output. The model learns by mapping inputs to known outputs. In contrast, unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, where the model identifies patterns, structures, or clusters without predefined answers."
          }
        ],
        "sampling_params": {
          "temperature": 0.7,
          "max_tokens": 100
        }
      }
    }
    ```
