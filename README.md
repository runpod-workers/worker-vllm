# Setting up the Serverless Worker

### Option 1: Deploy Any Model Using Pre-Built Docker Image [Recommended]
> [!TIP]
> This is the recommended way to deploy your model, as it does not require you to build a Docker image, upload heavy models to DockerHub and wait for workers to download them. Instead, use this option to deploy your model in a few clicks. For even more convenience, attach a network storage volume to your Endpoint, which will download the model once and share it across all workers.

We now offer a pre-built Docker Image for the vLLM Worker that you can configure entirely with Environment Variables when creating the RunPod Serverless Endpoint:

## RunPod Worker Images

Below is a summary of the available RunPod Worker images, categorized by image stability and CUDA version compatibility.

| CUDA Version | Stable Image Tag                  | Development Image Tag             | Note                                                        |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11.8.0       | `runpod/worker-vllm:0.3.0-cuda11.8.0`        | `runpod/worker-vllm:dev-cuda11.8.0`   | Available on all RunPod Workers without additional selection needed. |
| 12.1.0       | `runpod/worker-vllm:0.3.0-cuda12.1.0` | `runpod/worker-vllm:dev-cuda12.1.0` | When creating an Endpoint, select CUDA Version 12.2 and 12.1 in the filter. |

This table provides a quick reference to the image tags you should use based on the desired CUDA version and image stability (Stable or Development). Ensure to follow the selection note for CUDA 12.1.0 compatibility.

| `BLOCK_SIZE`                        | `16`                 | `8`, `16`, `32`                           |Token block size for contiguous chunks of tokens. |
| `SWAP_SPACE`                        | `4`                  | `int`                                         |CPU swap space size (GiB) per GPU. |
| `ENFORCE_EAGER`                     | `0`                  | boolean as `int`                                         |Always use eager-mode PyTorch. If False(`0`), will use eager mode and CUDA graph in hybrid for maximal performance and flexibility. |
| `MAX_CONTEXT_LEN_TO_CAPTURE`        | `8192`               | `int`                                     |Maximum context length covered by CUDA graphs. When a sequence has context length larger than this, we fall back to eager mode.|
| `DISABLE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE`         | `0`                  | `int`                                         |Enables or disables custom all reduce. |
**Streaming Batch Size Settings**:  
| `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`                | `50`                 | `int`                                         |Default and Maximum batch size for token streaming to reduce HTTP calls. |
| `DEFAULT_MIN_BATCH_SIZE`            | `1`                  | `int`                                         |Batch size for the first request, which will be multiplied by the growth factor every subsequent request. |
| `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE_GROWTH_FACTOR`  | `3`                  | `float`                                         |Growth factor for dynamic batch size. |
The way this works is that the first request will have a batch size of `DEFAULT_MIN_BATCH_SIZE`, and each subsequent request will have a batch size of `previous_batch_size * DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE_GROWTH_FACTOR`. This will continue until the batch size reaches `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`. E.g. for the default values, the batch sizes will be `1, 3, 9, 27, 50, 50, 50, ...`. You can also specify this per request, with inputs `max_batch_size`, `min_batch_size`, and `batch_size_growth_factor`. This has nothing to do with vLLM's internal batching, but rather the number of tokens sent in each HTTP request from the worker |
**OpenAI Settings**
| `RAW_OPENAI_OUTPUT`                 | `1`                  | boolean as `int`                                         |Enables raw OpenAI SSE format string output when streaming.  **Required** to be enabled (which it is by default) for OpenAI compatibility. |
| `OPENAI_SERVED_MODEL_NAME_OVERRIDE` | `None`               | `str`                                         |Overrides the name of the served model from model repo/path to specified name, which you will then be able to use the value for the `model` parameter when making OpenAI requests |
| `OPENAI_RESPONSE_ROLE`              | `assistant`          | `str`                       |Role of the LLM's Response in OpenAI Chat Completions. |
**Serverless Settings**
| `MAX_CONCURRENCY`                   | `300`                | `int`                                         |Max concurrent requests per worker. vLLM has an internal queue, so you don't have to worry about limiting by VRAM, this is for improving scaling/load balancing efficiency |
| `DISABLE_LOG_STATS`                 | `1`                  | boolean as `int`                                         |Enables or disables vLLM stats logging. |
| `DISABLE_LOG_REQUESTS`              | `1`                  | boolean as `int`                                         |Enables or disables vLLM request logging. |

> [!TIP]
> If you are facing issues when using Mixtral 8x7B, Quantized models, or handling unusual models/architectures, try setting `TRUST_REMOTE_CODE` to `1`.


### Option 2: Build Docker Image with Model Inside
To build an image with the model baked in, you must specify the following docker arguments when building the image.

#### Prerequisites
- RunPod Account
- Docker

#### Arguments:
- **Required**
  - `MODEL_NAME`
- **Optional**
  - `MODEL_REVISION`: Model revision to load (default: `main`).
  - `BASE_PATH`: Storage directory where huggingface cache and model will be located. (default: `/runpod-volume`, which will utilize network storage if you attach it or create a local directory within the image if you don't. If your intention is to bake the model into the image, you should set this to something like `/models` to make sure there are no issues if you were to accidentally attach network storage.)
  - `QUANTIZATION`
  - `WORKER_CUDA_VERSION`: `11.8.0` or `12.1.0` (default: `11.8.0` due to a small number of workers not having CUDA 12.1 support yet. `12.1.0` is recommended for optimal performance).
  - `TOKENIZER_NAME`: Tokenizer repository if you would like to use a different tokenizer than the one that comes with the model. (default: `None`, which uses the model's tokenizer)
  - `TOKENIZER_REVISION`: Tokenizer revision to load (default: `main`).

For the remaining settings, you may apply them as environment variables when running the container. Supported environment variables are listed in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

#### Example: Building an image with OpenChat-3.5
```bash
sudo docker build -t username/image:tag --build-arg MODEL_NAME="openchat/openchat_3.5" --build-arg BASE_PATH="/models" .
```

##### (Optional) Including Huggingface Token
If the model you would like to deploy is private or gated, you will need to include it during build time as a Docker secret, which will protect it from being exposed in the image and on DockerHub.
1. Enable Docker BuildKit (required for secrets).
```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
```
2. Export your Hugging Face token as an environment variable
```bash
export HF_TOKEN="your_token_here"
```
2. Add the token as a secret when building
```bash
docker build -t username/image:tag --secret id=HF_TOKEN --build-arg MODEL_NAME="openchat/openchat_3.5" .
```

## Compatible Model Architectures

# Usage: OpenAI Compatibility
The vLLM Worker is fully compatible with OpenAI's API, and you can use it with any OpenAI Codebase by changing only 3 lines in total. The supported routes are <ins>Chat Completions</ins>, <ins>Completions</ins> and <ins>Models</ins> - with both streaming and non-streaming.

## Modifying your OpenAI Codebase to use your deployed vLLM Worker 
**Python** (similar to Node.js, etc.):
1. When initializing the OpenAI Client in your code, change the `api_key` to your RunPod API Key and the `base_url` to your RunPod Serverless Endpoint URL in the following format: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1`, filling in your deployed endpoint ID. For example, if your Endpoint ID is `abc1234`, the URL would be `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/abc1234/openai/v1`. 
    
    - Before:
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
    ```
    - After:
    ```python
    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI(
        api_key=os.environ.get("RUNPOD_API_KEY"),
        base_url="https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1",
    )
    ```
2. Change the `model` parameter to your deployed model's name whenever using Completions or Chat Completions.
    - Before:
    ```python
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
        temperature=0,
        max_tokens=100,
    )
    ```
    - After:
    ```python
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
        temperature=0,
        max_tokens=100,
    )
    ```

**Using http requests**:
1. Change the `Authorization` header to your RunPod API Key and the `url` to your RunPod Serverless Endpoint URL in the following format: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1`
    - Before:
    ```bash
    curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"
      }
    ],
    "temperature": 0,
    "max_tokens": 100
    }'
    ```
    - After:
    ```bash
    curl https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR OPENAI API KEY>" \
    -d '{
    "model": "<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"
      }
    ],
    "temperature": 0,
    "max_tokens": 100
    }'
    ```

Examples of Open Source chat/instruct models include `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`, `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`, `openchat/openchat-3.5-0106`, `NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mistral-7B-DPO` and more. However, if your model is a completion-style model with no chat/instruct fine-tune and/or does not have a chat template, you can still use this if you provide a chat template with the environment variable `CUSTOM_CHAT_TEMPLATE`.
- **Streaming**:
  ```python
  # Create a chat completion stream
  response_stream = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=100,
      stream=True,
  )
  # Stream the response
  for response in response_stream:
      print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="", flush=True)
  ```
- **Non-Streaming**:
  ```python
  # Create a chat completion
  response = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
      messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is RunPod the best platform?"}],
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=100,
  )
  # Print the response
  print(response.choices[0].message.content)
  ```


### Completions:
This is the format used for models like GPT-3 and is meant for completing the text you provide. Instead of responding to your message, it will try to complete it. Examples of Open Source completions models include `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`, `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1`, `Qwen/Qwen-72B`, and more. However, you can use any model with this format.
- **Streaming**:
  ```python
  # Create a completion stream
  response_stream = client.completions.create(
      model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
      prompt="Runpod is the best platform because",
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=100,
      stream=True,
  )
  # Stream the response
  for response in response_stream:
      print(response.choices[0].text or "", end="", flush=True)
  ```
- **Non-Streaming**:
  ```python
  # Create a completion
  response = client.completions.create(
      model="<YOUR DEPLOYED MODEL REPO/NAME>",
      prompt="Runpod is the best platform because",
      temperature=0,
      max_tokens=100,
  )
  # Print the response
  print(response.choices[0].text)
  ```

### Getting a list of names for available models:
In the case of baking the model into the image, sometimes the repo may not be accepted as the `model` in the request. In this case, you can list the available models as shown below and use that name. 
```python
models_response = client.models.list()
list_of_models = [model.id for model in models_response]
print(list_of_models)
```

  You may either use a `prompt` or a list of `messages` as input. If you use `messages`, the model's chat template will be applied to the messages automatically, so the model must have one. If you use `prompt`, you may optionally apply the model's chat template to the prompt by setting `apply_chat_template` to `true`.

### Text Input Formats 
You may either use a `prompt` or a list of `messages` as input.
 1. `prompt` 
The prompt string can be any string, and the model's chat template will not be applied to it unless `apply_chat_template` is set to `true`, in which case it will be treated as a user message.

    Example:
    ```json
    "prompt": "..."
    ```
2. `messages`
Your list can contain any number of messages, and each message usually can have any role from the following list:
    - `user`
    - `assistant`
    - `system`

    However, some models may have different roles, so you should check the model's chat template to see which roles are required.

    The model's chat template will be applied to the messages automatically, so the model must have one.

    Example:
    ```json
    "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "..."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "..."
        },
        {
          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "..."
        }
      ]
    ```
